# iGed(iGame Game Engine Demo)

**iGed** is a lightweight game engine demo designed to showcase the core functionalities of a modern game engine. The
project is built as a practical demonstration of game engine development, with its core architecture and components
heavily inspired by **Hazel**, a well-known open-source game engine.
